        <h1 class="fancyHeading">About Me</h1>
        <p>As a student in web development, I am on a journey of discovery, immersing myself in a field that combines technology with creativity. Iâ€™m relatively new to web development but my interest grows with each line of code I write and every project I complete. While I am still at the beginning stages, I am motivated to become proficient in this field and am excited to bring my ideas to life through web design and development.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Alongside my studies, I have a deep passion for music particularly for playing the piano and guitar. Covering music has been a meaningful part of my life, providing a creative outlet and a source of inspiration. Whether I'm working through a challenging piece on the piano or experimenting with new chords on the guitar, music allows me to express myself and learn something new each time. This dual passion for technology and music has enriched my life and has given me a unique perspective that I hope to incorporate into my future career.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My journey in web development has been one of constant learning. I am still building my foundational knowledge, working on small projects and experimenting with different frameworks and tools. Every challenge I encounter presents an opportunity to grow and I am eager to improve my skills to be well-prepared for a career in web development. While it can be daunting to navigate a rapidly evolving field, I find joy in the process and look forward to where it will take me.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Looking ahead, I am determined to pursue a career as a web developer once I complete my studies. I aspire to join a team where I can continue to learn, contribute and eventually make a meaningful impact in the industry. My goal is to combine my technical skills with creativity, building websites that are not only functional but also engaging and user-friendly. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and am committed to making my dreams of becoming a web developer a reality.
